To Compile:
type:

To run
type:
	./cm <target source file> <output file> [-a|-s]
	
	target source file and output file are required. 
	-a is optional and will cause the abstract syntax tree to be printed to the specified output file. 
	-s is also optional and will cause the symbol table to be printed whenever context is moved up a level.
	
To clean up
type
	make clean
	
Included example files:

The test files can be found in the cminusCode/ directory. be sure to preface the source file name with the folder name when running.

1.cm:
compiles cleanly, takes in 3 numbers.  if the last 2 numbers multiplied together they are less than 20, the first will be added to them, and "20" will be printed out.
the results of those calulations will also be printed out.

2, 4 and 5.cm are just resubmitted from checkpoint 2.

I can bring along more examples of sowkring and not working code at the demo, but i'm already a bit past the deadline, so here's what I got.
