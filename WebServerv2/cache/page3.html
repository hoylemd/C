Here's some math stuff. (I never actually got around to implementing the math stuff.  I'll have it done for assignment 3 though. I'm not going to do any better with it at 3AM than i have for the past week. This is only here so I ahve an example of everything added.  Even though i diddnt actually add it. <br>
<MATH> \alpha = X^{3}


\frac{a+b}{c-d}


A \supset B \supset C


3 \div 2 \times 4


\Sigma_i \frac{a_{i}}{b-c}


\frac{
   \frac{a}{b} + c + \frac{1}{2}
}{
   d - \frac{i}{k} + f
}


X = \Sigma_{i=1}^{a+b+c} x_{i}  </MATH>
